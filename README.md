# LearnRN

This project is based on me and a friend discovering the React Native.

# Installation

I will assume that you got everything needed to build Mobile project (if you don't know, take a look at the official getting started doc for React Native there : https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

1 - clone repository 

2 - get inside any project you want to build

3 - run in command line ```npm install```

4 - for iOS build, use ```react-native run-ios```  // for Android build, use ```react-native run-android```
